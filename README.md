# EV Charging Station Placement Optimization in India

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing the placement of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across India using a three-tier network strategy. The goal is to improve EV accessibility by categorizing stations into slow (residential), medium (commercial), and fast (high-speed) charging types. By strategically placing these charging stations, this approach ensures a more efficient and sustainable EV ecosystem.

The project uses multi-level K-means clustering and grid-based coverage analysis to determine the most suitable locations. Synthetic data was generated due to the lack of publicly available datasets for EV demand and spatial distribution. This methodology also supports the integration of smart grid technology and aligns with national electrification goals.

## Features

- **Three-tier Charging Network**: 
  - **Slow Charging**: Residential overnight charging.
  - **Medium Charging**: Commercial area charging for 5-6 hour visits.
  - **Fast Charging**: High-speed charging for rapid turnaround.
  
- **K-means Clustering**: Used to categorize areas based on demand and proximity to residential and commercial locations.

- **Grid-based Coverage Analysis**: Ensures optimal placement for maximum accessibility.

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Simulates demand and spatial distribution of charging stations.

- **Smart Grid Integration**: Ensures alignment with smart grid technology for improved power management.

## Objective

- **Optimize EV Charging Station Placement**: To create an efficient distribution of charging stations that balances the needs of residential, commercial, and high-speed charging.
- **Support National Electrification Goals**: Align the project with India's EV adoption targets and infrastructure development.
- **Enable Smart Grid Integration**: Ensure the charging network supports the integration of smart grid technology for optimized power usage and distribution.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

* `numpy`: For numerical operations.
* `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
* `sklearn`: For K-means clustering and machine learning.
* `matplotlib`: For data visualization (optional).
* `geopy`: For geographic location calculations.

## Results

The output of the project is a set of optimized EV charging station locations, categorized into three tiers. The results will be saved in `optimized_locations.csv`, containing the geographical coordinates and associated tier for each charging station.

## Future Work

* **Real-world Data**: Integration of actual demand and spatial distribution data for more accurate predictions.
* **Dynamic Clustering**: Implement dynamic clustering based on real-time data, adjusting the placement of stations based on evolving usage patterns.
* **Enhanced Smart Grid Integration**: Explore more sophisticated smart grid features, including load balancing and real-time energy distribution.
* **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for visualizing station placement and system performance.
